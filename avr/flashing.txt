The fuses to burn differs a bit depending on which microcontroller is being used.
I have used the below fuses for ATmega328P but the same should be ok with ATmega328 too.

ATmega328/ATmega328P
====================
Lfuse FF
Hfuse DE
Efuse FD

And for ATmega48A I have used the following which I think should be ok for all 48/88/168 microcontrollers:

ATmega48/88/168
================
Lfuse FF
Hfuse DD
Efuse FE


Here are some examples for using AVRDUDE in Windows to upload firmware using a USBASP programmer and burning the fuses at the same time:

328P
====
avrdude.exe -C avrdude.conf -v -p atmega328p -c usbasp -U efuse:w:0xFD:m -U hfuse:w:0xDE:m -U lfuse:w:0xFF:m -U flash:w:amiga-par-to-spi-328.hex

48/48A
======
avrdude.exe -C avrdude.conf -v -p atmega48 -c usbasp -U efuse:w:0xFE:m -U hfuse:w:0xDD:m -U lfuse:w:0xFF:m -U flash:w:amiga-par-to-spi-48.hex

88/88A
======
avrdude.exe -C avrdude.conf -v -p atmega88 -c usbasp -U efuse:w:0xFE:m -U hfuse:w:0xDD:m -U lfuse:w:0xFF:m -U flash:w:amiga-par-to-spi-88.hex
